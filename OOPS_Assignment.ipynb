        "##Theorectical Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1) What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects, which are instances of classes. It focuses on structuring programs around real-world entities like objects and their interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is a real-world entity that has attributes (data) and behaviors (methods/functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction and Encapsulation are both key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming but serve different purposes. Abstraction focuses on hiding implementation details and only exposing the necessary functionalities to the user, making complex systems easier to use (e.g., driving a car without knowing its internal mechanics). On the other hand, Encapsulation is about binding data and methods together within a class and restricting direct access to sensitive information to ensure data integrity and security (e.g., private variables in a class that can only be accessed via getter and setter methods). While abstraction hides complexity, encapsulation protects data by controlling access.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder (short for double underscore) methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__). These methods automate certain behaviors and allow objects to interact with built-in Python functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where a child class (subclass) derives properties and behaviors from a parent class (superclass). This allows code reusability and hierarchical classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows the same function or method to work differently depending on the object or class that calls it. It helps in writing more flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved using private (__variable) and protected (_variable) attributes to restrict direct access to data. Private attributes can only be accessed using getter and setter methods, ensuring controlled modification. This protects sensitive data, maintains security, and enforces proper access control in a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9) What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor in Python is a special method __init__() that automatically executes when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize instance variables and set up object properties. This ensures that an object starts with predefined values when instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "10) What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- A class method (@classmethod) is bound to the class and can modify class variables, using cls as the first parameter. A static method (@staticmethod) does not depend on class or instance attributes and works like a regular function inside a class. Both are defined using decorators, @classmethod and @staticmethod, for better organization and reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading in Python means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Unlike other languages, Python does not support true method overloading, but we can achieve it using default arguments, *args, or @singledispatch. This allows a single method to handle different numbers or types of arguments flexibly.\n",
        "\n",
        "12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding in OOP occurs when a child class provides a new implementation of a method that already exists in the parent class. The overridden method in the child class must have the same name and parameters as in the parent class. This allows the child class to customize or change the behavior of the inherited method.\n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a property, allowing it to be accessed like an attribute without parentheses. It helps implement getter, setter, and deleter methods in a clean and readable way. This is useful for controlling access to private attributes while keeping the syntax simple.\n",
        "\n",
        "14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows different classes to use the same interface (method names) but with different implementations, making code more flexible and reusable. It enables method overriding and method overloading, improving scalability and maintainability. This helps in writing generalized code that works with multiple object types seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "15) What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It is defined using the ABC module and must have at least one abstract method (@abstractmethod), which must be implemented by child classes. This ensures that all subclasses follow a consistent structure while allowing customization.\n",
        "\n",
        "16) What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides code reusability through inheritance, reducing duplication and effort. It improves code organization and security using encapsulation, restricting direct access to data. Polymorphism allows flexibility by enabling multiple implementations of the same method, making code more scalable and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- A class variable is shared among all instances of a class and is defined outside any method, while an instance variable is unique to each object and defined inside a method using self. Changing a class variable affects all objects, but changing an instance variable affects only that specific object. Class variables are accessed using ClassName.variable, whereas instance variables use self.variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, enabling it to access attributes and methods from multiple sources. This helps in code reusability but can lead to complexity, especially with the Diamond Problem (resolved using the Method Resolution Order (MRO)).\n",
        "\n",
        "19) Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- The __str__ method in Python is used to return a user-friendly string representation of an object, mainly for display (print(obj)). The __repr__ method returns a developer-friendly and unambiguous representation, often used for debugging (repr(obj)). If __str__ is not defined, __repr__ is used as a fallback.\n",
        "\n",
        "20)  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function in Python allows a child class to call methods from its parent class, helping in code reuse and avoiding redundancy. It is commonly used in inheritance to call the parent class’s constructor (__init__()) or other methods. This is especially useful in multiple inheritance to ensure proper method resolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). Its main purpose is to free up resources, such as closing files or database connections, before the object is removed from memory. However, Python's automatic garbage collection usually handles memory management, so __del__ is rarely needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22) What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python.\n",
        "- @staticmethod: It belongs to the class but doesn’t use self or cls, meaning  \n",
        "  it doesn’t access class or instance data. It’s just a normal function inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  @classmethod: It uses cls as a parameter and can modify class variables, making it useful when we need to change something at the class level.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Key Difference: @staticmethod is like a normal function inside a class, while @classmethod can change class-level data using cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism with inheritance in Python allows a child class to provide its own version of a method while still following the parent class structure. This is done using method overriding, where the child class redefines a method from the parent class with a different implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "24) What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method Chaining in Python allows multiple methods to be called on the same object in a single line, improving code readability. Each method returns self, so the next method can be called directly on the returned object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. This means that if a class has __call__ defined, you can use object_name() to execute it, just like a function."
